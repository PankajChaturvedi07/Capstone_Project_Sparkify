# Capstone_Project_Sparkify

Libraries used: Pyspark, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn

Motivation of the project - Motivation behind this project is to understand the big data concept with Spark and as well as completion of data science nano degree program from Udacity.

Sparkify is a digital music service similar to Netease Cloud Music or QQ Music. Many of the users stream their favorite songs in Sparkify service everyday, either using free tier that places advertisements in between the songs, or using the premium subscription model where they stream music as free, but pay a monthly flat rate. User can upgrade, downgrade or cancel their service at anytime.

Analysis - Data cleaning, EDA (exploratory data to look features' distributions and correlation with key label), Feature engineering (extract and found customer-features and customer-behavior-features; Implement standscaler on numerical features), train and measure models (I choose logistic regression, linear svm classifier, decision tree and random forest classifier to train a baseline model and tuning a better model from best of them).
